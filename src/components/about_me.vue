                    Hello everyone,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    I am Sanil Desemaru from ittachhen-15,Bhaktapur,Nepal.
                    It's been a while, learning the different tools for the
                    web development, i've become preety confident working in front-end 
                    part of the web based projects. You can view some of the projects i have completed 
                    in <a href="#" @click="mygithub">My projects</a> section of this portfolio.<br>
                    Here are the lists of tools and programming languages i learned so far: <br>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript</li>
                    <li>A front-end framework "Vue js" </li>
                    <li>Git, npm</li>
                    <li>C, C++, Python, Php</li>    <br>
                    Being a student of computer science, i am quite interested in 
                    the world of programming. I wish to become a full-stack web developer and hopefully a software engineer 
                    in near future. So, wish me luck. Apart from these, i am passionate about photography, cycling.
